# Style Guide for Recipes

## Why do we need a style guide?

We want to make sure the recipes on this website are fully accessible for people with visual impairments. This means modifying the way we write out measurements, word our instructions, present doneness cues, and other things. 

## On screen reader compatibility

We want to remain screen reader friendly. A general rule of thumb here is to go through your recipe using JAWS or NVDA during the confirmation stage of your recipe submission. This will catch many of the snags that screen readers will get caught on. Some other things to keep in mind.

* When you want to express a fractional quantity, it is better to write it out in words rather than using the numerical representation. For example, write out “one half” instead of “½” or “1/2”. The latter two are not as accessible for screen readers, especially the single unicode character representing the fraction.

* Screen readers don’t usually read out punctuation like exclamation marks or question marks. Be sure to use descriptive language!
Less is more. People using screen readers have to sit through the whole text being read. Try to revise your recipes to avoid unnecessary tangents or wordiness.

## How to lay out your information

* It is generally good to put the ingredient quantities in the instruction set. For example, instead of saying “fold in the flour” say “fold in the half cup of flour”. Thus, the individual referencing the recipe through a screen reader does not have to navigate back up to the ingredients list and find the right ingredient, then navigate down to the instruction they were at.

## How to write your recipe to be more accessible

* Visual cues are often completely inaccessible, especially for newer cooks who don’t have the experience to know when something is “browned”. Knowing how to replace visual cues comes down to experience, and if you need help on how to rephrase a cue, feel free to contact us! However, here are some common visual cues and ways to replace them:

** Cook onions until translucent

*** Cook onions until they start to smell sweet or caramelized, and become flexible.

* Many times, a more tactile technique is better than the faster technique. For example, instead of throwing all the ingredients into a mixer, it is better to suggest, especially for newer cooks, to use a whisk or their hands to mix, so to feel when everything is fully mixed.
