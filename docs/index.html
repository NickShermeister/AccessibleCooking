        <h2> Our Challenge Statement</h2>
        <p>
                We want to help visually impaired cooks of all levels advance their ability to cook in a way that
                is affordable, because adaptive technology is often prohibitively expensive and resources are 
                dispersed or inaccessible.

                We also strive to help visually impaired adults who are new to cooking learn new, adaptive techniques 
                for cooking because learning to cook gives a sense of independence and empowerment, and these 
                techniques and recipes are not well documented or available to a large number of visually impaired adults.
