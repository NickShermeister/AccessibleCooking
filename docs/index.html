<p>
    We worked with Brian Charleson to create a website where users with visual impairments can
    submit and find recipes. This was inspired by the many barriers Brian faced in learning new
    recipes. Finding the recipe is a challenge, since books are expensive -- especially
    Braille books. In addition, a very small percentage of the blind population can read Braille.
    Resources on the internet are often frustrating and inaccessible. In Brian's words, 9 out of
    10 recipe websites he finds on Google are inaccessible, and if it is not immediately easy to
    use, he moves on to another website. After recipes are found, many of the recipes are worded
    inaccessibly. For example, some recipes will use the slash character to write fractions, or
    use the unicode characters for fractions, neither of which are particularly screen reader
    friendly. Many recipes often use visual cues, such as "cook onions until translucent" or "bake
    until golden brown," which require lots of cooking experience to translate. The result is that
    learning a new recipe takes days, and require a lot of work on behalf of the cook to parse
    through all the recipes and rewrite a version that makes more sense to them.

    Our goal was to create a website where people with visual impairments can share their own
    recipes, with the idea that people who are visually impaired write their recipes with
    accessibility in mind. This will allow higher level cooks to share their research and
    knowledge with each other, as well as lower the barrier to entry for lower skilled cooks,
    since these recipes will be hosted on an accessible website, and the recipes will have
    adaptations specifically for people with visual impairments.
