<h1>Code Architecture</h1>

<p>
    Our website is built on Flask, MongoDB, and Heroku. The image below shows the general software
    system.
</p>

    recipe page and a submit recipe page, and Flask goes between the Heroku app and the Mongo
    database.">

<p>
    Searching for recipes is based on the title and tags of the recipe. <strong>More on searching
    here</strong>
</p>

<p>
    When a user submits a recipe or tip, we also automatically detect and fix formatting problems,
    such as writing out fractions. <strong>Other things we may or may not be detecting, or hope to detect</strong>
