title: Sightless Chef's Design Process
---

<h1>Design Process</h1>
<p> We followed a user-centric design process over the course of six weeks to identify an issue
and iterate on a solution with our project partner, Brian Charlson. Through our conversations with
Brian, we identified the accessibility of cooking resources as a problem that Brian and many others
in the visually impaired community faces.</p>
